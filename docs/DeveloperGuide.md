## **2. Design**

### 2.1 Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="500" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete can 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="600" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 2.2 UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `JobListPanel`, `PersonDetailedView`, `JobDetailedView` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* Responds to events raised by various commands which may result in changed to the UI.

### 2.3 Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a candidate).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete can 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete can 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeletePersonCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### 2.4 Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Job>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to these lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components. <br>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The Model class diagram shown above omits certain details due to space constraints, namely the classes in the Information Package 
                                                                             that Person and Job hold reference to. Instead, the omitted details have been extracted and are shown here: <br>

![InformationClassDiagram](images/InformationClassDiagram.png)

</div>
 

### 2.5 Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* Implements both `PersonAddressBookStorage` and `JobAddressBookStorage`
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save `PersonAddressBook` data and `JobAddressBook` data in json format and read it back.
* `JsonPersonAddressBookStorage` and `JsonJobAddressBookStorage` is reponsible for saving the datas in json format.


### 2.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **3. Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 3.1 Add feature

The Add feature has two variants, one for adding candidates `add can` and one for adding jobs `add job`. We will illustrate this feature using only the candidates variant here
as the job variant works analogously.

The implemented add mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`. They both implement `Model` and contain `FilteredList` of filtered `Person`. `FilteredList` is a subclass of `ObservableList`.

Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `ModelManager#hasPerson(Person person)` —  Check whether the same person exist in the FilteredList of persons using the `equals` method of `Persons`.

* `ModelManager#addPerson(Person person)` —  Adds the person into the FilteredList of persons.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `add can` mechanism behaves at each step. 

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `FilteredList` will be initialised with the `UniquePersonList` from `personAddressBook` which contains a list of candidates.

Step 2. The user executes `add can n/John p/98765432 e/john@ex.com a/John street exp/5 doa/15-10-20` to add a candidate with `Name` John, `Phone` 98765432, `Email` john@ex.com, `Address` John street, `Experience` 5 and `Date` 15-10-20.

Step 3. The method `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` is invoked to determine the command type. Since this is an `add can` command, the `AddPersonCommandParser#parse` is then called to parse the arguments. If the input command has an invalid format, `AddPersonCommandParser` throws a `ParseException`, if not, a `AddPersonCommand` object is created.

Step 4. `ModelManager#hasJob(Person person)` is invoked to check whether the same person exist in the FilteredList of persons using the `equals` method of `Person`. If a duplicate person exists, a `CommandException` is thrown. Otherwise, the method `ModelManager#addPerson(Person person)` is invoked to add the person into the FilteredList of persons.

Step 5. The `savePersonAddressBook` method of `StorageManager`, which is a subclass of `Storage`, is invoked to update the new person addition in the `personAddressBook` and saved. 

The following sequence diagram shows how the `add can` operation works in the scenario described above:

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

:information_source: **Note:** The usage scenario and sequence diagram for the analogous `add job` operation are mostly similar, using its `AddJobCommandParser`, `AddJobCommand`, `hasJob`, `addJob`, `saveJobAddressBook` and `JobAddressBook` counterparts.

### 3.2 Edit feature

The Edit feature has two variants, one for editing candidates `edit can` and one for editing jobs `edit job`. We will illustrate this feature using only the candidates variant here
as the job variant works analogously. 

The implemented edit mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`.  It implements `Model` and contains a `FilteredList`, which is a subclass of `ObservableList`. 
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `ModelManager#setPerson(Person target, Person editedPerson)` —  Replaces the Person target  with editedPerson.

* `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person> predicate)` —  Updates the FilteredList of persons using the supplied predicate.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `FilteredList` will be initialised with the `UniquePersonList` from `personAddressBook` which contains a list of candidates.

Step 2. The user executes `edit can 2 n/Rob Mi` to change the `Name` of the candidate at `Index` 2 to Rob Mi. 

Step 3. The method `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` is invoked to distinguish which type of command it is. After discerning it is an `edit can` command,
the `EditPersonCommandParser#parse` is then invoked to parse the arguments.
If the command format is invalid, `EditPersonCommandParser` throws an error.

Step 4. A `EditPersonDescriptor` object, which is an inner class of `EditPersonCommand`, is created from parsing the command and is used
to store the details to edit the candidate with. In this case, it stores the `Name` Rob Mi.

Step 5. A `EditPersonCommand` object is also created from parsing the comamand. In the `EditPersonCommand#execute` method, 
if the candidate `Index` provided by the user is invalid, an error is thrown. 
Otherwise, the method `ModelManager#setPerson()` is invoked to replace the old candidate with the newly edited candidate. 
 Then, `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList()` is invoked and the `FilteredList` and `personAddressBook` is updated and saved.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit operation works in the scenario described above:

![EditSequenceDiagram](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

:information_source: **Note:** The usage scenario and sequence diagram for the analogous `edit job` operation are mostly similar, using its `EditJobDescriptor`, `EditJobCommand`, `EditJobCommandParser`, `UniqueJobList` and `JobAddressBook` counterparts.

### 3.3 List feature

The List feature has two variants, one for listing candidates `list can` and one for listing jobs `list job`. We will illustrate this feature using only the candidates variant here
as the job variant works analogously.

The implemented list mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It implements `Model` and contains a `FilteredList`, which is a subclass of `ObservableList`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person> predicate)` —  Updates the FilteredList of candidates using the supplied predicate.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `FilteredList` will be initialised with the `UniquePersonList` from `personAddressBook` which contains a list of candidates.

Step 2. The user executes `list can` to list all candidates.

Step 3. A `ListPersonCommand` object is created from parsing the command. In the `ListPersonCommand#execute` the method `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS)` is invoked 
and the `FilteredList` shows all candidates in the list as indicated by the given predicate.

The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation works in the scenario described above:

![ListSequenceDiagram](images/ListSequenceDiagram.png)

:information_source: **Note:** The usage scenario and sequence diagram for the analogous `list can` operation are mostly similar, using its `ListCanCommand`, `UniquePersonList` and `PersonAddressBook` counterpart.

### 3.4 Sort feature

The Sort feature has two variants, one for sorting candidates `sort can` and one for sorting jobs `sort job`. We will illustrate this feature using only the candidates variant here
as the job variant works analogously.

The implemented sort mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It implements `Model` and contains a `SortedList`, which is a subclass of `ObservableList`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `ModelManager#updateSortedPersonList(Comparator<Person> comp)` —  Sorts the current SortedList of persons using the supplied comparator.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `SortedList` will be initialised with the `UniquePersonList` from `personAddressBook` which contains a list of candidates.

Step 2. The user executes `sort can type/exp order/asc` to sort the candidates by their `Experience` in ascending order. If the `type` of comparator field i.e. `exp` or the `order` i.e. `asc` is missing, `SortPersonCommandParser` throws an error message.

Step 3. A `PersonExperienceComparator` is created from parsing the command and a `SortPersonCommand` object is created. In the `SortPersonCommand#execute` the method `ModelManager#updateSortedPersonList(PersonExperienceComparator)` is invoked and the `SortedList` is sorted using the `PersonExperienceComparator`. The `UniquePersonList` in `personAddressBook` is then set to be the `SortedList`.

![SortPersonSequenceDiagram](images/SortSequenceDiagramC.png )

:information_source: **Note:** The usage scenario and sequence diagram for the analogous `sort job` operation are mostly similar, using its `SortJobCommand` ,`SortJobCommandParser`, `UniqueJobList` and `JobAddressBook` counterparts.

### 3.5 Find feature

The Find feature has two variants, one for finding candidates `find can` and one for finding jobs `find job`. We will illustrate this feature using only the candidates variant here
as the job variant works analogously.

The implemented find mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It implements `Model` and contains a `FilteredList`, which is a subclass of `ObservableList`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person> predicate)` —  Updates the FilteredList of persons using the supplied predicate.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `FilteredList` will be initialised with the `UniquePersonList` from `personAddressBook` which contains a list of candidates.

Step 2. The user executes `find can n/Alex exp/0` to find candidates with the `Name` Alex and `Experience` 5.

Step 3. A `PersonNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `PersonExperienceContainsKeywordsPredicate` which are subclasses of `Predicate` are created from parsing the command and a `FindPersonCommand` object is created.

Step 4. In the `FindPersonCommand#execute`, the method `composePredicatesList(List<Predicate<Person>> predicates)` is invoked to produce a `Predicate<Person>` that represents a short-circuiting logical AND of all predicates in the list.
`ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person>)` is invoked and the `FilteredList` is filtered using the `Predicate<Person>` returned by the method `composePredicatesList`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation works in the scenario described above:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

:information_source: **Note:** The usage scenario and sequence diagram for the analogous `find job` operation are mostly similar, using its `FindJobCommand`, `FindJobCommandParser`, `UniqueJobList` and `JobAddressBook` counterparts.

The above only demonstrates finding candidates by their `Name` and `Experience`.
The find operation also supports finding candidates via other fields such as `Email` and `Vacancy`.

### 3.6 View feature

The Edit feature has two variants, one for adding candidates `add can` and one for adding jobs `add job`. We will illustrate this feature using only the candidates variant here
as the job variant works analogously.

The implemented view feature has two variants `view can` and `view job` for viewing a candidate and viewing a job respectively.

The mechanism for both view features are faciliated by `ModelManager` and `MainWindow`. `ModelManager` implements model and contains a `displayedPerson` which is of type `Person` and a `displayedJob` which is of type `Job`.

 `ModelManager` implements the following operations:

* `ModelManager#setDisplayedPerson(Person person)` — Sets the `displayedPerson` in the `ModelManager` class to be the supplied person.
* `ModelManager#setDisplayedJob(Job job)` — Sets the `displayedJob` in the `ModelManager` class to be the supplied job.

`MainWindow` implements the following operations:

* `MainWindow#updateDetailedPersonPanel(Person person)` — Updates the view on the right panel of the GUI to contain information of the supplied person.
* `MainWindow#updateDetailedJobPanel(Job job)` — Updates the view on the right panel of the GUI to contain information of the supplied job.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `view can` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `displayedPerson` will be initialised with `null`.

Step 2. The user executes `view can 1` to show the candidate at `Index` 1 on the right panel of the GUI.

Step 3. The method `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` is invoked to distinguish which type of command it is. After discerning it is an `view can` command, the `ViewPersonCommandParser#parse` is then invoked to parse the arguments. If the command format is invalid, `ViewPersonCommandParser` throws an error.

Step 4. A `ViewPersonCommand` object is created from parsing the argument.

Step 5. In the `ViewPersonCommand#execute` method, the `ModelManager#getFilteredPersonList()` is invoked to obtain a `displayablePersons` which is a list of the candidates in the address book. The supplied `Index` is then used to obtain the `Person` in `displayablePerson` to be displayed. The method `ModelManager#setDisplayedPerson(Person person)` is invoked to set the person to be displayed to be the `Person` obtained from `displayablePersons`.

Step 6. A `CommandResult` object is created from `ViewPersonCommand#execute`. The method `MainWindow#updateDetailedPersonPanel(Person person)` is also invoked from the execution of the command.

Step 7. Candidate at `Index` 1 is now displayed on the right panel.

The following sequence diagram shows how the view operation works in the scenario described above:

![ViewSequenceDiagram](images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png)

:information_source: **Note:** The usage scenario and sequence diagram for the analogous `view job` operation are mostly similar, using its `ViewJobCommand`, `ViewJobCommandParser`, `displayableJobs` and `displayedJob` counterparts.

## **4. Proposed Features**

### 4.1 Undo/redo feature

#### 4.1.1 Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedPersonAddressBook`. It extends `PersonAddressBook` and `VersionedJobAddressBook` respectively with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `personAddressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedPersonAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current person address book state in its history.
* `VersionedPersonAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous person address book state from its history.
* `VersionedPersonAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone person address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitPersonAddressBook()`, `Model#undoPersonAddressBook()` and `Model#redoPersonAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedPersonAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial person address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single person address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete can 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete can` command calls `Model#commitPersonAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the person address book after the `delete can 5` command executes to be saved in the `personAddressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted person address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add can n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add can` command also calls `Model#commitPersonAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressPersonBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitPersonAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `personAddressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo can` command. The `undo can` command will call `Model#undoPersonAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous person address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial PersonAddressBook state, then there are no previous PersonAddressBook states to restore. The `undo can` command uses `Model#canUndoPersonAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the `undo can` operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoPersonCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo can` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoPersonAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the person address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `personAddressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest person address book state, then there are no undone PersonAddressBook states to restore. The `redo can` command uses `Model#canRedoPersonAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list can`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list can` and `help`, will usually not call `Model#commitPersonAddressBook()`, `Model#undoPersonAddressBook()` or `Model#redoPersonAddressBook()`. Thus, the `personAddressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear can`, which calls `Model#commitPersonAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `personAddressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add can n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** The analogous `redo job` and `undo job` features can be implemented in the same way, using its `VersionedJobAddressBook`, `JobAddressBook` and `jobAddressBookStateList` counterparts.

</div>

#### 4.1.2 Design consideration

##### 4.1.2.1 Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete can`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
