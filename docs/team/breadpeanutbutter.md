## Project: CANdidates

CANdidates is a powerful contact management desktop App optimised for job recruiters to manage job applicants and job listings.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 25 kLoC.

### Given below are my contributions to the project

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=breadpeanutbutter&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&tabOpen=false)

* **New Feature: Experience Information field**
  * What it is for: A field used to represent the number of years of experience of a candidate. Internally, it is represented as an Experience object.
  * Justification: This Information field allows job recruiters to store and keep track of the number of years of experience that candidates have.
    This is an important value that most employers look out for. This field is also useful when used as input for the Sort and Find features. <br>

* **New Feature: URL Link Information field**     
  * What it is for: A field used to represent a URL link to a candidate's profile such as his/her LinkedIn or Github page. 
    It is an optional input field for candidates since not all candidates have an online profile page. Internally, it is represented as a UrlLink object.
  * Justification: This Information field allows job recruiters to have easy access to the URL link to profiles and resumes of candidates. 
  * Highlight: This field was the first information field that was optional for candidates and also have no default value. It was a challenge to
    implement this field as I had to consider how to make it reflect no value while adhering to good coding practices. I wanted to avoid using
    null values for this as using nulls can be "overwhelmingly likely to cause errors" as said by Brian Goetz, Java's language architect. 
    Hence, I decided to utilise Java's Optional class to contain UrlLink in an Optional object for safer results. 
  * Hightlight: It was also a challenge to validate the format of URL links as there are numerous possibilities. I decided to use a third party library, 
    Apache Commons Validator, to validate the format for this. <br>
    
* **New Feature: Salary Information field**           
  * What it is for: A field used to represent the expected salary of a candidate. It is an optional input field for candidates. 
    Internally, it is represented as a Salary object.
  * Justification:  This Information field allows job recruiters to store and keep track of the expected salary of candidates. This is an important field
    as recruiters can use this information to match candidates with suitable jobs. This field is also useful when used as input for the Sort and Find features.
  * Highlight: Similar to URLLink, Salary is also represented as an Optional object in candidates. <br>
  
* **New Feature: Date Information field**           
  * What it is for: A field used to represent the date of application of a candidate. Internally, it is represented as a Date object.
  * Justification: This Information field allows job recruiters to keep track of the date that candidates applied for a job. This is important as 
    job recruiters should not take too long to follow up with candidates. 
    This field is also useful when used as input for the Sort and Find features. <br>

* **New Feature: Blacklist Information field**           
  * What it is for: A field used to represent the blacklist status of candidates, i.e whether a candidate has been blacklisted.
  * Justification: This Information field allows job recruiters to keep track of candidates who have been blacklisted and have bad records. 
    This field is also useful when used as input for the Sort and Find features. <br>
