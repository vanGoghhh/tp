## Project: CANdidates

CANdidates is a powerful contact management desktop app optimised for job recruiters to manage job applicants.

The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.

### Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to store priority of job listings.
  * What it does: Allows the user to label a job listing by a priority level. It also acts as an optional field, which takes on a 
  default value, moderate.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as it differentiates the job list from the original AB3, 
  making it significantly personalised for job recruiters to use our application to manage many job listings at once.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added subsequently, such as find and sort commands. 
  This enhancement was also challenging as it was the first information field that was optional which had to take on a default value and 
  no other similar implementations exists in the original codebase. A good understanding of the logic flow of the code base is required due to the multitude of classes and method involved.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to store vacancies of job listings.
  * What it does: Allows the user to label a job listing with its number of vacancies.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as it differentiates the job list from the original AB3, 
  making it significantly personalised for job recruiters to use our application to manage job listings.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added subsequently, such as find and sort commands. 
  A good understanding of the logic flow of the code base is required due to the multitude of classes and method involved.
<br>
<br>
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to sort job listings.
  * What it does: Sorts the list of jobs by their job title, company name, priority level or number of vacancies in an ascending or descending order.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can quickly sort the items with a single command. 
  A well organised and sorted list of jobs makes it easier for the user to view job listings according to various criteria and match suitable candidates to jobs.
  * Highlights: This enhancement is challenging as it is a fresh implementation and no similar implementations exists in the original codebase of AddressBook 3. 
  Thus a good understanding of the logic flow of the code base is required due to the multitude of classes and methods involved.
