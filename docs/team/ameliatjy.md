* Role: Developer
* Responsibilities: Scheduling and Tracking

### Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature: Job Listings** (Pull requests [\#84](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/84) and [\#94](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/94))
  * What it does: The feature enables a job listing to be represented in the CANdidates application.
  * Justification: The implementation of this feature is the preliminary modification of AB3 uniquely into CANdidates. It enables CANdidates to subsequently roll out features for job listings.
  * Highlights: This allows job recruiters to store job listings in CANdidates to keep track of all jobs with recruitment opportunities.

* **New Feature: Find Candidate(s) Feature** (Pull requests [\#148](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/148), [\#153](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/153) and [\#167](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/167))
  * What it does: Enables the user to find candidates with field(s) that contain(s) specified keywords.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a typical job recruiter has many candidates to handle, this feature will provide a convenient way for them to look for suitable candidates that fulfil a certain criteria and streamline their search.
  * Highlights: This enhancement was challenging as it requires chaining of various predicates, based on the fields specified by the user, to achieve the desired outcome. An in-depth understanding of the code base and its logic flow are required due to the numerous other classes involved.

* **New Feature: Find Job Listing(s) Feature**
  * What it does: Enables the user to find job listings with field(s) that contain(s) specified keywords.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a typical job recruiter has many job listings to handle. This feature will provide a convenient way for them to look for job listings with specific keywords, streamlining their search, thereby helping him/her fulfil the recruitment required in a timely manner.
