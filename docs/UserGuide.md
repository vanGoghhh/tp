### 2.2 Understanding Symbols
This section explains all the symbols and fonts used in this document.

Symbols/Font   | Explanation
---------------|------------------------------------
`command`      | A string that is highlighted in grey indicates that the string is describing a typed command. The string could be a command format, a full command or part of a command.
{*Description*}| Curly braces indicates a variable field that is described by *Description*. This is used to display results of commands that vary depending on a user's specific data. For example, the number of jobs in the list is variable and would depend on the user's data, hence this is represented as {*Number of jobs*} in this User Guide.

### 2.3 Understanding the CANdidates GUI
The figure below shows an annotated version of the GUI, to help you in understanding some of the technical terms used regarding our GUI. <br>
You may refer back to this section whenever you need help understanding the GUI terms.

![Annotated GUI](images/UnderstandingGUI.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:memo: *In the Tab Buttons, the tab you are currently on is marked as red. i.e. "Jobs" button is in red as the list currently shows the list of jobs.*

### 2.4 Understanding Input Fields
Input fields are fields that you specify in your commands to tell *CANdidates* eaxctly what you wish to do, such as the
information to store. Most input fields have specific requirements that have to be fulfilled or *CANdidates* will not be able to 
understand you! The table below provides a summary of the requirements, but do not worry if you cannot
remember them because *CANdidates* will notify you with an error message if any of these requirements 
are not met, and you can then make the relevant changes!

If you feel unsure while exploring this section due to the lack of prior context, fret not! You will certainly understand
better when you read about the commands in the later sections. Try taking a quick glance at the command formats
in [Section 4. Features for Candidates](#4-features-for-candidates)  or [Section 5. Features for Jobs](#5-features-for-jobs)!

You may refer to this table whenever you need help understanding the input fields.

This will help you to understand *CANdidates*' features better.

* Command formats are highlighted in grey as mentioned in [Section 2.2. Understanding Symbols](#22-understanding-symbols)

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the input fields which are supposed to be specified by you. -fields)<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a input field which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `c/COMPANY_NAME [t/JOB_DESCRIPTION]` can be used as `c/Samsung t/ContractWorker` or just `c/Samsung`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times. You can put as much information as you want to!<br>
  e.g. `[t/JOB_TYPE]…` can be used as `t/accountant` (i.e. 1 time), `t/programmer t/technician` (i.e. 2 times) etc.

* Input fields can be in any order you want them to be.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

*:bulb: If you need help with the various input fields, refer to [Section 2.4. Understanding Input Fields](#24-understanding-input-fields).*

<br>

### 4.2 Listing all candidates: `list can`

To accurately reflect the latest changes of candidates in the application, you can refresh the list of candidates using the format below.

**Format:** `list can`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: *This command can be used after a* [`find can`](#44-finding-a-candidate-find-can) *command to show the full list of candidates again.*
</div>
<br>

### 4.3 Editing a candidate: `edit can`

If you would like to edit the details of a particular candidate, you can use the command below.

**Format:** `edit can INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [exp/YEARS_OF_EXPERIENCE] [doa/DATE_OF_APPLICATION] [a/ADDRESS] [sal/EXPECTED_SALARY] [bl/IS_BLACKLISTED] [link/PROFILE_LINK] [t/JOB_TYPE]…`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

<br>
:memo: *Existing values will be updated to the input values.*
<br>
:memo: *At least one of the optional fields must be provided.*
<br>
:memo: *The blacklist input can be specified as* `bl/true` *or* `bl/false`.
<br>

<br>
:bulb: *Certain optional candidate fields can be cleared by typing their respective prefixes without specifying any value after them. 
This works for the job type, address, expected salary and profile link fields. See the second example below for a demonstration.*

</div>

**Examples:**

:black_nib: To edit the 1st candidate’s phone number, email and blacklist status to be _91234567_, _johndoe<span>@</span>example.com_ and _true_ respectively,

    edit can 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com bl/true

:black_nib: To edit the 2nd candidate and clear existing job types, address, expected salary and profile link,

    edit can 2 t/ a/ sal/ link/ 
    
**Step by Step:**

Step 1. Ensure there is at least 1 candidate in the candidates list. <br>
Type `edit can 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com bl/true` in the *command box* and press *Enter*.

![Edit Can Step 1](images/editCan1.png)

<br>

Step 2. The result of the command in the *result display* will depend on the specific candidate that is being edited, specifically his/her input fields that were not edited. 
The message that will be shown in the *result display* is
>Edited candidate: {Original Name} Phone: 91234567 Email: john<span>doe</span>@example.com Experience: {Original Experience} Date of Application: {Original Date of Application} Address: {Original Address} Link: {Original Link} Expected Salary: {Original Expected Salary} Blacklisted: true Tags: {Original Tags}.

<br>

Step 3. The application will show the updated list of candidates with the edited candidate. Type `view can 1` or click the edited candidate's
card to view the candidate's new information in detail.

![Edit Can Step 2](images/editCan2.png)

<br>

### 4.4 Finding a candidate: `find can`

Too many candidates with different information? *CANdidates* provide you with a simple and quick way for you to find 
candidates who fulfil certain criteria(s) or even a specific candidate from the long list. All you have to do is tell *CANdidates* 
the field you are interested in, along with the keyword you are looking for!

**Format:** `find can [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [exp/YEARS_OF_EXPERIENCE] [doa/DATE_OF_APPLICATION] [a/ADDRESS] [sal/EXPECTED_SALARY] [bl/IS_BLACKLISTED] [link/PROFILE_LINK] [t/JOB_TYPE]…`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:memo: *At least one of the optional fields must be provided.*
<br>
:memo: *The search is case insensitive, e.g. john will match John*
<br>
:memo: *The order of the keywords does not matter, e.g. Doe John will match John Doe*
<br>
:memo: *For number fields (i.e. phone, years of experience and expected salary), only exact matching results will be displayed. For the remaining fields, results containing and exactly matching the keywords will be displayed.*
<br>
:memo: *If there are multiple inputs for the same field, only the last one will be detected.*
<br>
:bulb: *If you do not want to see blacklisted candidates in the list, you can use the command `find can bl/false`, the resulting list will show only non-blacklisted candidates.*
<br>
:bulb: *If you want to find candidates with no expected salary, you can use the command `sort can type/sal order/asc`
(Refer to [Section 4.5, Sorting all candidates](#45-sorting-all-candidates-sort-can).
Candidates with no expected salary will be displayed at the top of the list.*

</div>

**Examples:**

:black_nib: To find candidates with tag(s) containing the word “_developer_” and an expected salary of exactly _$4000_,

    find can t/developer sal/4000

:black_nib: To find candidates who are _blacklisted_,

    find can bl/true

**Step by Step:**

Step 1. Type `find can n/David t/Teacher` in the *command box* and press *Enter*.

![Find Can Step 1](images/findCan1.png)

<br>

Step 2. The *CANdidates* application will show the following message in the *result display*.
>{Number of candidates found} candidates listed!

<br>

Step 3. The application will show candidates with all matching fields in the *main list*.

![Find Can Step 2](images/findCan2.png)

<br>

### 4.5 Sorting all candidates: `sort can`

You can view all the candidates in the order you wish to by typing in your desired order. Upon execution of the command, the sorted list of candidates would be displayed on the app!

**Format:** `sort can type/FIELD_TO_SORT order/ORDER`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:exclamation: *Sorting will only apply to the current viewable list. e.g. Using* `sort can` *command after a* `find can` *command will only sort the list of candidates that were listed after the* `find can` *command.*
<br>
:memo: *The type input must be one of* `type/n`, `type/exp`, `type/sal`, `type/bl` *or* `type/doa` *depending on whether you wish to sort the candidates by their name, experience, expected salary, blacklist status or data of application respectively.*
<br>
:memo: *The order input must be specified as either* `order/asc` *or* `order/desc` *depending on whether you wish the sorting to be done in an ascending or descending manner.*
<br>
:memo: *If you provide more than one* `FIELD_TO_SORT` *or* `ORDER` *, only the last one will be taken in as input e.g.* `sort can type/exp order/asc type/sal order/desc` *will sort the candidates according to expected salary in descending order.* 
<br>

</div>

**Examples:**

:black_nib: To sort the list of candidates starting from the lowest number of years of experience,

    sort can type/exp order/asc

:black_nib: To sort the list of candidates starting from the most recent application date,

    sort can type/doa order/desc

:black_nib: To view all blacklisted candidates followed by non-blacklisted candidates,

    sort can type/bl order/desc
    
**Step by Step:**

Step 1. Type `sort can type/exp order/asc` in the *command box* and press *Enter*.

![Sort Can Step 1](images/sortCan1.png)

<br>

Step 2. The *CANdidates* application will show the following message in the *result display*.
>Successfully sorted list of candidates by years of experience in ascending order.

<br>

Step 3. The application will show the sorted candidates list based on the sort condition given.

![Sort Can Step 2](images/sortCan2.png)

<br>

### 4.6 Deleting a candidate: `delete can`

Have you successfully found a job for a candidate and you no longer need to keep his/her details in *CANdidates*? 
To delete a particular candidate from the list, you can use the command below.

**Format:** `delete can INDEX`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:memo: *Deletes the candidate at the specified* `INDEX`. *The* `INDEX` *refers to the index number shown in the displayed job list. The* `INDEX` *must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, …​*
<br>
:exclamation: *The specified candidate’s data will be cleared and this action is irreversible. 
Please ensure you do not require the candidate’s data anymore before performing this command.*

</div>

**Examples:**

:black_nib: To delete the candidate at index _1_,

    delete can 1

:black_nib: To delete the candidate at index _3_,

    delete can 3
    
**Step by Step:**

Step 1. Ensure there is at least 1 candidate in the candidate list. <br>
Type `delete can 1` in the *command box* and press *Enter*.

![Delete Can Step 1](images/deleteCan1.png)

<br>

Step 2. The result of the command in the *result display* will depend on the specific candidate that is being deleted.
The message that will be shown in the *result display* is
>Deleted candidate: {Name} Phone: {Phone} Email: {Email} Experience: {Experience} Date of Application: {Date of application} Address: {Address} Link: {Link}  Expected Salary: {Expected salary} Blacklisted: {Blacklist status} Tags: {Tags}

<br>

Step 3. The application will show the updated candidates list without the deleted candidate.

![Delete Can Step 2](images/deleteCan2.png)

<br>

### 4.7 Viewing a candidate: `view can`

Want to view all the information of a particular candidate? *CANdidates* provides an easy way for you to do it! Simply utilise the command below to display all the information of a candidate on the *display panel* of the application!

**Format** `view can INDEX`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:memo: *Displays all the information of a candidate at the specified* `INDEX`. *The* `INDEX` *refers to the index number shown in the displayed job list.*
<br>
:exclamation: `INDEX` *refers to the number beside the name of the candidate in the Main List. Thus* `INDEX` *cannot be a number lesser than the number beside the first candidate in the list or greater than the number beside the last candidate in the list.*

</div>

**Examples:**

:black_nib: To view the candidate at index _1_,

    view can 1

:black_nib: To view the candidate at index _3_,

    view can 3

**Step by Step:**

simply by inserting keywords for the field(s) you are looking for!

**Format:** `find job [n/JOB_TITLE] [c/COMPANY_NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [v/VACANCY] [pr/PRIORITY] [t/JOB_DESCRIPTION]…`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

<br>
:memo: *The search is case insensitive, e.g. samsung will match Samsung*
<br>
:memo: *The order of the keywords does not matter, e.g. King Burger will match Burger King*
<br>
:memo: *For number fields (i.e. phone and vacancy), only exact matching results will be displayed. For the remaining fields, results containing and exactly matching the keywords will be displayed.*
<br>
:memo: *If there are multiple inputs for the same field, only the last one will be detected.*

</div>

**Examples:**

:black_nib: To find jobs with email containing “_@gmail.com_” and priority level _high_,

### 5.5 Sorting all jobs: `sort job`

Have too many job listings and need a way to organise them? You can get *CANdidates* to help you do that by sorting them according to the priority or vacancies you have indicated for the job listings!

**Format** `sort job type/FIELD_TO_SORT order/ORDER`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:exclamation: *Sorting will only apply to the current viewable list. e.g. Using* `sort job` *command after a* `find job` *command will only sort the list of job listings that were listed after the* `find job` *command.*
<br>
:memo: *The* `FIELD_TO_SORT` *can be either* `n`, `c`, `pr` *or* `v` *depending on whether you wish to sort the job listings by the job title, company name, priority level or number of vacancies respectively.*
<br>
:memo: *If you provide more than one* `FIELD_TO_SORT` *or* `ORDER` *, only the last one will be taken in as input e.g.* `sort job type/pr order/asc type/v order/desc` *will sort the job listings according to vacancies in descending order.* 
<br>
:memo: *The* `ORDER` *can be either* `asc` *or* `desc` *depending on whether you wish the sorting to be done in an ascending or descending manner.*

</div>

**Examples:**

:black_nib: To sort the list of jobs starting from lowest priority,

    sort job type/pr order/asc

To delete a particular job from the list, you can use the command below.

**Format:** `delete job INDEX`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

<br>
:exclamation: *The specified job’s data will be cleared and this action is irreversible.

## **7. FAQ**

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the sample data file it creates with the file that contains the data from your previous *CANdidates* root folder.

**Q**: Where is the data stored and how can I access it?<br>
**A**: The data is stored in the "data" folder in your *CANdidates* root folder. The candidate data is stored in the personaddressbook.jsonfile
       while the job data is stored in the jobaddressbook.json file.
       
**Q**: Can I modify the data from the data files directly?<br>
**A**: We recommend that you do not modify the data files unless you are an advanced user, and that you make any changes through the UI instead. 
       In the event that the data becomes corrupted, *CANdidates* will start up with sample data as a fallback. There is a risk of losing
       all your original data should this happen. Should you still wish to modify the data files directly, we recommend that you first create a copy
       of the original data files as a back-up in case the data becomes corrupt after modification.     

**Q**: I modified my existing data file and it is now corrupted. My *CANdidates* application started up with the sample data. How can I get my data back?<br>
**A**: Currently, our application is unfortunately not able to support recovering corrupted data files. We are sorry for any inconveniences caused. 

**Q**: How do I report a bug I encountered?<br>
**A**: Send an email to *developers@CANdidates.com* with a description and screenshot (if relevant) of the bug. We will make sure to get back to you promptly!

**Q**: How can I contribute to this project?<br>
**A**: You may create a pull request to this [repository](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp). Here is our [developer's guide](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-t17-3.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html) for your reference.
