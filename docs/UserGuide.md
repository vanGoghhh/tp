### 2.4 Understanding Command Format

This section will explain how to interpret all the command formats which you will encounter in [Section 4. Features for Candidates](#4-features-for-candidates), [Section 5. Features for Jobs](#5-features-for-jobs) and [Section 6. Other Features](#6-other-features).
This will help you to understand *CANdidates*' features better.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the input fields which are supposed to be specified by you.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a input field which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `c/COMPANY_NAME [t/JOB_DESCRIPTION]` can be used as `c/Samsung t/ContractWorker` or just `c/Samsung`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times. You can put as much information as you want to!<br>
  e.g. `[t/JOB_TYPE]…` can be used as `t/accountant` (i.e. 1 time), `t/programmer t/technician` (i.e. 2 times) etc.

* Input fields can be in any order you want them to be.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

*:bulb: If you are confused with the various input fields, refer to [Section 2.3. Understanding Input Fields](#23-understanding-input-fields).*

![Add Candidate 2](images/addCan2.png)

<br>

### 4.2 Listing all candidates: `list can`

To accurately reflect the latest changes of candidates in the application, you can refresh the list of candidates using the format below.

**Format:** `list can`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: *This command is usually used after a* [`find can`](#44-finding-a-candidate-find-can) *or* [`sort can`](#45-sorting-all-candidates-sort-can) *command to show the full list of candidates again.*
</div>
<br>

### 4.3 Editing a candidate: `edit can`

If you would like to edit the details of a particular candidate, you can use the command below.

**Format:** `edit can INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [exp/YEARS_OF_EXPERIENCE] [doa/DATE_OF_APPLICATION] [a/ADDRESS] [sal/EXPECTED_SALARY] [bl/IS_BLACKLISTED] [link/PROFILE_LINK] [t/JOB_TYPE]…`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:memo: *Edits the candidate at the specified* `INDEX`. *The* `INDEX` *refers to the index number shown in the displayed candidate list. The* `INDEX` *must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, …​*
<br>
:memo: *Existing values will be updated to the input values.*
<br>
:memo: *At least one of the optional fields must be provided.*
<br>
:memo: *The blacklist input can be specified as* `bl/true` *or* `bl/false`.
<br>
:exclamation: *When editing the job type, the existing job types will be cleared and replaced, i.e editing of job types is not cumulative even though there can be multiple job types.*
<br>
:bulb: *Certain optional candidate fields can be cleared by typing their respective prefixes without specifying any value after them. 
This works for the job type, address, expected salary and profile link fields. See the second example below for a demonstration.*

</div>

**Examples:**

:black_nib: To edit the 1st candidate’s phone number, email and blacklist status to be _91234567_, _johndoe<span>@</span>example.com_ and _true_ respectively,

    edit can 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com bl/true

:black_nib: To edit the 2nd candidate and clear existing job types, address, expected salary and profile link,

    edit can 2 t/ a/ sal/ link/ 
    
**Step by Step:**

Step 1. Ensure there is at least 1 candidate in the candidates list. <br>
Type `edit can 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com bl/true` in the *command box* and press *Enter*.

![Edit Can Step 1](images/editCan1.png)

<br>

Step 2. The command result will depend on the specific candidate that is being edited and the input fields that were not edited. 
Representing the original values of the candidate's input fields which were not edited as "{}", the message that will be shown in the *result display* is
>Edited candidate: {Name of candidate} Phone: 91234567 Email: john<span>doe</span>@example.com Experience: {} Date of Application: {} Address: {} Link: {} Expected Salary: {} Blacklisted:true Tags: {}.

<br>

Step 3. The application will show the updated list of candidates with the edited candidate. Type `view can 1` or click the edited candidate's
card to view the candidate's new information in detail.

![Edit Can Step 2](images/editCan2.png)

<br>

### 4.4 Finding a candidate: `find can`

Too many candidates with different information? *CANdidates* provide you with a simple and quick way for you to find 
candidates who fulfil certain criteria(s) or even a specific candidate from the long list. All you have to do is tell *CANdidates* 
the field you are interested in, along with the keyword you are looking for!

**Format:** `find can [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [exp/YEARS_OF_EXPERIENCE] [doa/DATE_OF_APPLICATION] [a/ADDRESS] [sal/EXPECTED_SALARY] [bl/IS_BLACKLISTED] [link/PROFILE_LINK] [t/JOB_TYPE]…`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:memo: *At least one of the optional fields must be provided.*
<br>
:memo: *The search is case insensitive, e.g. john will match John*
<br>
:memo: *The order of the keywords does not matter, e.g. Doe John will match John Doe*
<br>
:memo: *For number fields (i.e. phone, years of experience and expected salary), only exact matching results will be displayed. For the remaining fields, results containing and exactly matching the keywords will be displayed.*
<br>
:memo: *If there are multiple inputs for the same field, only the last one will be detected.*
<br>
:bulb: *If you do not want to see blacklisted candidates in the list, you can use the command `find can bl/false`, the resulting list will show only non-blacklisted candidates.*
<br>
:bulb: *If you want to find candidates with no expected salary, you can use the command `sort can type/sal order/asc`
(Refer to [Section 4.5, Sorting all candidates](#45-sorting-all-candidates-sort-can).
Candidates with no expected salary will be displayed at the top of the list.*

</div>

**Examples:**

:black_nib: To find candidates with tag(s) containing the word “_developer_” and an expected salary of exactly _$4000_,

    find can t/developer sal/4000

:black_nib: To find candidates who are _blacklisted_,

    find can bl/true

**Step by Step:**

Step 1. Type `find can n/David t/Teacher` in the *command box* and press *Enter*.

<br>

### 4.5 Sorting all candidates: `sort can`

You can view all the candidates in the order you wish to by typing in your desired order. Upon execution of the command, the sorted list of candidates would be displayed on the app!

**Format:** `sort can type/FIELD_TO_SORT order/ORDER`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:exclamation: *Sorting will only apply to the current viewable list. e.g. Using* `sort can` *command after a* `find can` *command will only sort the list of candidates that were listed after the* `find can` *command.*
<br>
:memo: *The type input must be one of* `type/n`, `type/exp`, `type/sal`, `type/bl` *or* `type/doa` *depending on whether you wish to sort the candidates by their name, experience, expected salary, blacklist status or data of application respectively.*
<br>
:memo: *The order input must be specified as either* `order/asc` *or* `order/desc` *depending on whether you wish the sorting to be done in an ascending or descending manner.*
<br>
:memo: *If you provide more than one* `FIELD_TO_SORT` *or* `ORDER` *, only the last one will be taken in as input e.g.* `sort can type/exp order/asc type/sal order/desc` *will sort the candidates according to expected salary in descending order.* 
<br>

</div>

**Examples:**

:black_nib: To sort the list of candidates starting from the lowest number of years of experience,

    sort can type/exp order/asc

:black_nib: To sort the list of candidates starting from the most recent application date,

    sort can type/doa order/desc

:black_nib: To view all blacklisted candidates followed by non-blacklisted candidates,

    sort can type/bl order/desc
    
**Step by Step:**

Step 1. Type `sort can type/exp order/asc` in the *command box* and press *Enter*.

![Sort Can Step 1](images/sortCan1.png)

<br>

>Successfully sorted list of candidates by years of experience in ascending order.

<br>

Step 3. The application will show the sorted candidates list based on the sort condition given.

![Sort Can Step 2](images/sortCan2.png)

<br>

### 4.6 Deleting a candidate: `delete can`

Have you successfully found a job for a candidate and you no longer need to keep his/her details in *CANdidates*? 
To delete a particular candidate from the list, you can use the command below.

**Format:** `delete can INDEX`

:memo: *Deletes the candidate at the specified* `INDEX`. *The* `INDEX` *refers to the index number shown in the displayed job list. The* `INDEX` *must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, …​*
<br>
:exclamation: *The specified candidate’s data will be cleared and this action is irreversible. 
Please ensure you do not require the candidate’s data anymore before performing this command.*

</div>

**Examples:**

:black_nib: To delete the candidate at index _1_,

    delete can 1

    delete can 3
    
**Step by Step:**

Step 1. Ensure there is at least 1 candidate in the candidate list. <br>
Type `delete can 1` in the *command box* and press *Enter*.

![Delete Can Step 1](images/deleteCan1.png)

<br>

Step 2. The command result will depend on the specific candidate that is being deleted.
Representing the values of the candidate's input fields as "{}", the message that will be shown in the *result display* is
>Deleted candidate: {Name of candidate} Phone: {} Email: {} Experience: {} Date of Application: {} Address: {} Link: {}  Expected Salary: {} Blacklisted: {} Tags: {}

<br>

### 5.2 Listing all jobs: `list job`

To accurately reflect the latest changes of jobs in the application, you can refresh the job listings using the format below.

**Format:** `list job`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: *This command is usually used after a* [`find job`](#54-finding-a-job-find-job) *or* [`sort job`](#55-sorting-all-jobs-sort-job) *command to show the full list of job listings again.*
</div>
<br>

### 5.3 Editing a job: `edit job`

If you would like to edit the details of a particular job, you can use the command below.

**Format:** `edit job INDEX [n/JOB_TITLE] [c/COMPANY_NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [v/VACANCY] [pr/PRIORITY] [t/JOB_DESCRIPTION]…`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:memo: *Edits the job at the specified* `INDEX`. *The* `INDEX` *refers to the index number shown in the displayed job list. The* `INDEX` *must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, …​*
<br>
:memo: *Existing values will be updated to the input values.*
<br>
:memo: *At least one of the optional fields must be provided.*
<br>
:memo: *The priority input can be specified as* `pr/low`, `pr/moderate` *or* `pr/moderate`.
<br>
:exclamation: *When editing the job description, the existing job descriptions will be cleared and replaced, 
i.e editing of job descriptions is not cumulative even though there can be multiple job descriptions.*
<br>
:bulb: *Existing job descriptions can be cleared by typing t/ without specifying any value after it. 
See the second example below for a demonstration.*

</div>

**Examples:**

:black_nib: To edit the 1st job’s company name, phone number, vacancy and priority to be _Dog Cafe_, _82827731_, _3_ and _high_ respectively,


    edit job 1 c/Dog Cafe p/82827731 v/3 pr/high

:black_nib: To edit the 3rd job and clear existing job descriptions, 

    edit job 3 t/

Type `edit job 1 c/Dog Cafe p/82827731 v/3 pr/high` in the *command box* and press *Enter*.

![Edit Job Step 1](images/editJob1.png)

<br>

Step 2. The command result will depend on the specific job that is being edited and the input fields that were not edited. 
Representing the original values of the job's input fields which were not edited as "{}", the message that will be shown in the *result display* is
>Edited job: {Job Title} Company: Dog Cafe Phone: 82827731 Email: {} Address: {} Priority: high Vacancy: 3 Tags: {}

<br>

Step 3. The application will show the updated list of jobs with the edited job. Type `view job 1` or click the edited job's

### 5.4 Finding a job: `find job`

Too many job listings with different information? You can find job listings that have certain criteria(s) or even a specific one from the long list 
simply by inserting keywords for the field(s) you are looking for!

**Format:** `find job [n/JOB_TITLE] [c/COMPANY_NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [v/VACANCY] [pr/PRIORITY] [t/JOB_DESCRIPTION]…`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:memo: *At least one of the optional fields must be provided.*
<br>
:memo: *The search is case insensitive, e.g. samsung will match Samsung*
<br>
:memo: *The order of the keywords does not matter, e.g. King Burger will match Burger King*
<br>
:memo: *For number fields (i.e. phone and vacancy), only exact matching results will be displayed. For the remaining fields, results containing and exactly matching the keywords will be displayed.*
<br>
:memo: *If there are multiple inputs for the same field, only the last one will be detected.*

</div>

**Examples:**

:black_nib: To find jobs with email containing “_@gmail.com_” and priority level _high_,

    find job e/@gmail.com pr/high

### 5.5 Sorting all jobs: `sort job`

Have too many job listings and need a way to organise them? You can get *CANdidates* to help you do that by sorting them according to the priority or vacancies you have indicated for the job listings!

**Format** `sort job type/FIELD_TO_SORT order/ORDER`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:exclamation: *Sorting will only apply to the current viewable list. e.g. Using* `sort job` *command after a* `find job` *command will only sort the list of job listings that were listed after the* `find job` *command.*
<br>
:memo: *The* `FIELD_TO_SORT` *can be either* `n`, `c`, `pr` *or* `v` *depending on whether you wish to sort the job listings by the job title, company name, priority level or number of vacancies respectively.*
<br>
:memo: *If you provide more than one* `FIELD_TO_SORT` *or* `ORDER` *, only the last one will be taken in as input e.g.* `sort job type/pr order/asc type/v order/desc` *will sort the job listings according to vacancies in descending order.* 
<br>
:memo: *The* `ORDER` *can be either* `asc` *or* `desc` *depending on whether you wish the sorting to be done in an ascending or descending manner.*

</div>

**Examples:**

:black_nib: To sort the list of jobs starting from lowest priority,

    sort job type/pr order/asc

:black_nib: To sort the list of jobs starting from the highest number of vacancies,

    sort job type/v order/desc

To delete a particular job from the list, you can use the command below.

**Format:** `delete job INDEX`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:memo: *Deletes the job at the specified* `INDEX`. *The* `INDEX` *refers to the index number shown in the displayed job list. The* `INDEX` *must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, …​*
<br>
:exclamation: *The specified job’s data will be cleared and this action is irreversible. 
Please ensure you do not require the job’s data anymore before performing this command.*

## **7. FAQ**

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the sample data file it creates with the file that contains the data from your previous *CANdidates* root folder.

**Q**: Where is the data stored and how can I access it?<br>
**A**: The data is stored in the "data" folder in your *CANdidates* root folder. The candidate data is stored in the personaddressbook.jsonfile
       while the job data is stored in the jobaddressbook.json file.
       
**Q**: Can I modify the data from the data files directly?<br>
**A**: We recommend that you do not modify the data files unless you are an advanced user, and that you make any changes through the UI instead. 
       In the event that the data becomes corrupted, *CANdidates* will start up with sample data as a fallback. There is a risk of losing
       all your original data should this happen.      

**Q**: I modified my existing data file and it is now corrupted. My *CANdidates* application started up with the sample data. How can I get my data back?<br>
**A**: Currently, our application is unfortunately not able to support recovering corrupted data files. We are sorry for any inconveniences caused. 

**Q**: How do I report a bug I encountered?<br>
**A**: Send an email to *developers@CANdidates.com* with a description and screenshot (if relevant) of the bug. We will make sure to get back to you promptly!

**Q**: How can I contribute to this project?<br>
**A**: You may create a pull request to this [repository](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp). Here is our [developer's guide](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-t17-3.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html) for your reference.
