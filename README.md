CANdidates is a powerful contact management application optimised for job recruiters; a brownfield project based on [Address Book Level-3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/). 

While it has a Graphics User Interface (GUI). most of the user interactions happen using a Command Line Interface (CLI).

Job Recruiters can:

* Track candidates according to which job listing they are interested in
* Centralised and categorised relevant contacts of all candidiates 
* Reduce the hassle of having to look for applicants repeatedly on different platforms for each new job posting.
